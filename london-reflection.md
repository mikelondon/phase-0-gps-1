Answer these questions in your reflection:

What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
 - Prior to the GPS session I was having trouble navigating between branches. I also was completely confused on remote and fetch. I thought that you could just use the command git pull which would fetch/merge in one.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
 - Using git checkout moves between branches.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
 - I asked them questions on what was troubling me and that cleared things up. I am still a little fuzzy on fetch / remote but I know that will come with more practice.  Git pull is also a compact way to fetch and merge in one.

What still confuses you about git?
 -  When using the remote I am still not completely sure on what it does. I will need to do more research and practice while I work on the HTML this week.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
 -  My first experience was great! I really enjoyed working with my partner and the guide had some great pointers. Once again my feelings toward DBC are getting better and better as the days go on. I am having a great time learning things that interest me.
